in which the foot pedal is usually designed like a rocker
or there are two pedals left and right,
each for backwards and forwards.
If you press the pedal for one direction of travel,
the vehicle moves as a percentage of the pedal
- However, the engine speed remains unchanged (idle).
This leads to the maximum speed
is not achieved.
The hand throttle must be used for this.
At 100% hand throttle, the driving speed can be adjusted
still serve percentage,
because it is a hydraulic drive.
Furthermore, the front loader is used on wheel loaders
depending on the hand throttle in performance,
i.e. the lower the engine speed
- which is also the pump speed
- the slower the hydraulic lifting cylinders move.
In addition, the heavier a front-loading tool is
and the heavier it is loaded,
the speed drops when lifting,
the lower the hand throttle is set.
Be careful, operate the engine when the engine is still cold
Front loader can cause the engine to stall."/>

Depending on the manufacturer - but I won't go into all of them.
In addition to a brake, there is usually only one accelerator pedal instead of two.
There is also a joystik or something similar that you can use to move forward,
Return to neutral if necessary. If you press the accelerator pedal,
The engine speed regulates automatically and the vehicle accelerates
on the percentage of pedal operation.
Furthermore, the engine speed increases automatically,
as soon as the front loader is operated - as long as the accelerator pedal is pressed at least 0.001%.
At 0% pedal position, the hand throttle must still be used to ensure a minimum speed.
In reality it's a little different, but unfortunately it can't be implemented quite like that in the game mechanics."/>
